# Container-JFR-Core

Core library providing a convenience wrapper and headless stubs for managing
JFR with JDK Mission Control API

## Requirements
Build:
- Maven
- JDK11+
- JMC 7.1.1-SNAPSHOT artifacts

## Build

The Maven build expects to be able to find Java Mission Control (JMC)
artefacts in the local Maven repository. To ensure these are available, clone
the JMC project at the [JMC homepage](https://hg.openjdk.java.net/jmc/jmc7)
and follow its build instructions. Run `mvn install` in the jmc project root to
install its artefacts to the local repository. After this is complete, the
project in this repository may be built locally.

`mvn install` to compile this core library and publish the artifacts to the
local Maven repository for consumption by other projects.
